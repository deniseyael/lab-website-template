Hi, I am Xiaoran, a M.Eng student in the Department of Computing and Software at McMaster University. I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Manitoba. I am passionate about developing software for robotic control and designing innovative Human-Robot Interaction. Previously, I worked as a backend developer intern in the software engineering field, where I deepened my practical knowledge. Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, photography, and video games.
