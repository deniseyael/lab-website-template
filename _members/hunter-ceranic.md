Hunter is a Software Engineering M.ASc student at McMaster, and native Hamiltonian, with a strong interest in the intersection between human psychology and modern engineering. Throughout his undergraduate degree in Mechatronics Engineering & Society (with a minor in Psychology), Hunter cultivated a passion for learning about robotics through his own interactions with them and decided to further investigate their uniquely profound effects on the people and social environment around us. Hunter is also generally interested in the ethics of robotics and AI as the technologies develop further and become more commonplace. Outside of the lab Hunter is an avid writer, reader, and all-around life-long learner, who enjoys playing sports and games with friends and never shies away from committing to the bit.
